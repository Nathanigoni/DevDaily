✅ DevDaily – Developer Learning Tracker
💡 Core Problem:
Developers often finish a day feeling like they didn’t achieve anything — even if they did. DevDaily helps track learning and progress to fight that feeling.

🔑 Key Features
1. Daily Log
Simple input form:

What did you learn? (textarea)

Tags: (multi-select: frontend, backend, tooling, bugfix, refactor, etc)

Date: default to today

Save logs in:

LocalStorage (MVP)

Optional upgrade: Firebase Auth + Firestore (for sync across devices)

2. Progress & Streaks
Show:

Streak counter (how many days in a row you've logged)

Total entries

Breakdown by tags (Pie/Bar chart – use chart.js or recharts)

3. Dev Diary Export
Export all logs as a .txt or .md file:
